### Hi there üëã

I code, I hack.

I manage servers + networks.

I'm Aida, a 18 year old who loves anime, gaming, game modding, 
reverse engineering, having servers, having private 4G LTE network, 
making websites, videos, art, 3d stuff, animation and also pretty much entrepreneur.

Basically, almost anything that's got to do something with computers/IT, I probably can do it. 
<br><em>If not, open for new challanges, and learning more stuff! ‚ù§Ô∏è</em>

FLOSS - SysAdmin - Security - Reverse Enginner - Economy - History - Technology - GamesDev<br>
Blender 3D - Graphics design/Art - Media - Language - Linux - Lifestyle - Philosophy - Software - Science
